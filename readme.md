# Laravel Sass Starter
> a quick way to start your saas applications

## Introduction
The laravel-saas -starter project is a quick way to boostrap and quickly start your saas apps its endeavours to make several of the core features you need available by default so you don't have to always re-make the wheel.

Some of these include 

  - Quick Authentication
  - Billing and Subscription Structures
    - Integration with stripe, paystack and paypal (future development)
  - Api Integrations for api based application
  - An associate react based frontend for the application.
  - Easy porting to blade-template based development.


## Progress
At the moment the boilerplate is at its initial development state. we follow the [semantic versioning system](https://semver.org) versioning system, at the moment the library is at its version 0.1.0, meaning its still in development.

## Contributions
Due to current contraints at the moment the project is not open to contributions until the first release, I do hope to be able to initialize it then and make it a community favourite if possible.
